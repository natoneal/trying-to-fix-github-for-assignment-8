Project 8 Write-Up

The website for homework 8 is located at: https://natoneal.github.io/assgn8/

Part 1: 
	The purpose of my website is to present a unified, engaging experience for users to view my user experience design portfolio. As a new user experience designer, I do not have a large breadth of work to show on my website, so I need to make sure that the relevant projects that I do have, are shown to their full potential. In that vein, since I am in the process of building my portfolio, I have built two templates for the project pages, to ensure that I can easily add new projects to my website in the future, even when I am busy with other work. I convey the basic information on how to contact me, my education, resume, etc. I also include information on my projects and background. I also include a section on my hobby of fine art. Which allows potential employers the chance to learn about me beyond my design work. This is generally important because designers generally work on teams, so finding out the fit of a potential designer is important. My portfolio presents my projects in a modern and engaging way. The main page starts with a carousel of visually beautiful pictures from my best projects. The clear order of the site allows the user to navigate between projects easily, while the minimal design emphasizes the visuals of the projects. The target audience of my portfolio website is potential employers.

Part 2: Use a bulleted list to describe how a user would interact with your website. For each item in your list, say the interaction type you implemented (e.g. speech, gesture, form-based wizard, standard web page, etc)

Carousel on mainpage:
standard web page
The main page starts with a carousel of photos
Click on the left and right arrow buttons to go between the photos of the carousel.

Hamburger menu on the top right side of every page:
Click on the hamburger menu located in the top left corner of every page.
standard web page

Click on the pictures located on the fine art page: 
Photoswipe tool allows the user to scroll left and right through the photos, without leaving the enlarged view. 
Standard web page

Hover over the project photos on the bottom of the mainpage and up slides more information about the project in the picture
standard web interaction



Part 3:
Bootstrap: 
I chose to use it, because I did not know of any good alternatives, and it seemed like it was highly suggested that I implement it in my portfolio. 
I used it on all of the html pages, in the css, to add responsiveness to my portfolio site
It adds responsiveness to the website, allowing the website to change between mobile and desktop web views.

flickity:
Since I knew I wanted a carousel on the home page, I found a javascript library to help make it easier and more professional looking.
I used flickity to create the carousel on the home page of my portfolio.
It adds touch and responsiveness to my carousel.

photoswipe:
I wanted the user to go be able to go through the enlarged photos located in my fine arts page.
I used it on the fine art gallery page, allowing users to enlarge photographs and scroll through them.
It adds functionality to the fine art gallery, allowing users to easily view the images larger.

gsap: 
gsap is a powerful animation tool for javascript, and it seemed more straight forward to use than react.
I used it to do small animations such as the hamburger menu wiggle when the curser hovers over it.
gsap adds a layer of interaction/animation to the website that helps the website feel more professional.

Part 4:
	I changed the visual design of my website to create a more polished, professional appearance than my earlier HW7 mockup. The changes from my original design include: changing the color palette (removing the yellow from the color palette of the sight and adding in a gray), removing the organic shapes located around the main page, removing the opening animation, making individual pages for each of the project pages (instead of creating a template), etc. There is now a hamburger menu in the upper right corner, which smoothly converts between desktop and mobile web views. Based on the feedback I received from other students, the new design that I implemented is cleaner, and more modern, which is a better reflection of my design esthetic.

Part 5:
	I encountered multiple challenges early in the website creation process. In the beginning it took me hours to understand how to download bootstrap and attach it to the html files. It also took me a while to realize that multiple css files could be attached to an html file, and that order of the css files on the html file gave precedence to certain css files. Once I got past the initial setup of the files when not starting from scratch (and utilizing other tools like bootstrap and photoswipe), there were fewer problems that I got stuck on for serious amounts of time.
